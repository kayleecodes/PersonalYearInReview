<p>One of my goals in 2018 was to take more advatage of living in North Jersey and attend events and see sights in the area. I was able to do that and attended the following events and saw some sites.</p>
<li>Montclair, NJ - Attended the Montclair Film Festival and saw a live interview with Nick Offerman</li>
<li>Newark, NJ - Went to bloomfest and saw the second largest collection of Cherry Blossoms in the U.S.</li>
<li>NYC - Attended the Women Techmakers summit at Google and was overwhelmed by the amount of inspiring women speakers, especially Jessica Matthews, who created a soccer ball which harvests kinetic energy at just 19. </li>
<li>NYC - Attended the AWS summit and learned a lot about serverless architecture and offerings in the cloud.</li>
<li>Philadelphia, PA - I will count the Philadelphia Zoo's Oktobearfest as "local" even though it isn't quite as close as the other things on this list. An awesome fundraiser for the zoo which consists of drinking beer samples and walking around to view the animals. Could not ask for anything more.</li>
<li>Jackson, NJ - We got season passes to Six Flags and attended frightfest. </li>
<li>NYC - Visited Brooklyn Botanical Gardens with my mom when she came to visit.</li>
<li>West Orange, NJ - Was able to see Thomas Edison's house and laboratory, where they still have a lot of fascinating historic objects.</li>
